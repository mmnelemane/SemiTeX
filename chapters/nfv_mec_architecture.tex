The NFV Infrastructure provides the necessary foundation for realizing all the pillars including MEC and NFV\@. The infrastructure mainly provides functions to automatically deploy and manage virtualized resources. Several requirements for NFV and MEC overlap and due to the similarities, a combined architecture for NFV and MEC was proposed in \cite{taleb17}. The idea is to use a common Infrastructure platform to run Virtual Application Functions (VAFs) and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). The corresponding orchestration modules are named as AFVO and NFVO\@. This common platform allows for reduced design issues and massive reuse of components thereby saving in CapeX and OpeX costs. A paper in [2] represents a combined architecture as in the above diagram.


Here is a table comaparing the terminologies used between NFV and MEC
